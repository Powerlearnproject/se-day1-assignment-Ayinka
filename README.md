Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):

Before: Programming was often unstructured and difficult to understand or maintain.
Milestone: The introduction of structured programming paradigms, such as top-down design and modularization, made software more readable, maintainable, and reliable. Languages like Pascal and C played a pivotal role in popularizing structured programming.
Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s):

Before: Programming focused on procedures and data separately.
Milestone: Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged, emphasizing the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on that data. Languages like Smalltalk, C++, and Java revolutionized software development by promoting code reusability, flexibility, and encapsulation.
Agile Software Development (2000s):

Before: Traditional software development methods often followed a rigid waterfall model, where requirements were defined upfront, and development proceeded in linear stages.
Milestone: The Agile Manifesto, emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change, introduced a more flexible and adaptive approach. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban gained popularity, leading to faster development cycles, improved customer satisfaction, and better adaptability to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that outlines the various stages involved in creating software. It helps ensure a structured and systematic approach to development. Here are the common phases:

Planning:

This phase involves defining the project's scope, goals, and requirements.
Key activities include feasibility studies, market analysis, and creating a project plan.
Requirements Analysis:

This phase involves gathering detailed information about the software's functionality, features, and constraints.
Techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops are used to gather requirements from stakeholders.
Design:

The design phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the software, outlining its architecture, components, and interactions.
This includes creating system diagrams, data flow diagrams, and user interface designs.
Development:

This phase involves writing the actual code that implements the design.
Developers use programming languages, tools, and frameworks to build the software.
Testing:

The testing phase involves identifying and fixing defects in the software.
Various testing techniques are used, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
Deployment:

This phase involves releasing the software to the target environment (e.g., production servers).
It may include activities like installation, configuration, and data migration.
Maintenance:

This phase involves ongoing activities to ensure the software continues to function properly.
It includes bug fixes, updates, and enhancements.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is better suited for projects with stable requirements and predictable timelines, while Agile methodologies are more suitable for projects with uncertain requirements and a need for flexibility. The choice between the two depends on the specific characteristics of the project and the preferences of the development team.
